<h1>Oral Lesion Detection Algorithm</h1>


This repository contains the implementation of an Oral Lesion Detection Algorithm developed in collaboration with Newcastle University. The goal of this project is to expedite preliminary oral cancer diagnosis in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for oral lesion detection.

The algorithm explores various lightweight Single Shot and Zero Shot detection models that allow for fast and accurate identification of oral lesions from medical images. This approach is designed to be deployable on low-resource devices, ensuring that it can be utilized effectively in regions with poorer healthcare infrastructure.

The project aims to contribute to early detection and timely referral of patients for further diagnosis and treatment, helping bridge the gap in oral cancer care in underserved areas.
